### Project Description
Informal workers like cobblers and plumbers are hard to find because they aren’t digitally listed. This platform helps users discover nearby workers by location, ratings, and reviews, and crowdsources listings with images, locations, and availability tags for reliability.

### The Problem statement
Millions of informal skilled workers like cobblers, plumbers, electricians, and street food vendors are not digitally discoverable because they may not have smartphones, digital access, or familiarity with apps. This makes it difficult for people to find nearby services quickly. Existing platforms focus on registered professionals, leaving many local, street‑level workers invisible and hard to locate or trust.

### The Solution
SpotAble is a location‑based platform that helps users discover nearby informal workers like cobblers, plumbers, electricians, and street food vendors. Users can view workers sorted by distance, ratings, and reviews, and contribute by uploading images and locations. SpotAble also shows a “Might not be available” tag after inactivity, improving reliability and helping users make informed decisions.
